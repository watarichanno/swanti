[align=justify][font=Avenir, Segoe UI, sans-serif][size=120][b]The Portrait of the South Pacific[/b] is a graphical representation of all World Assembly nations in [region]the South Pacific[/region] and the endorsements between them. We hope this portrait will show you how large and dynamic this region is. If your nation is too small to see below, you can click on the image to view the full-size version and then zoom. Alternatively, you can read below on how to become big and notable so that everyone can easily see you![/size][/font][/align]

[font=Avenir, Segoe UI, sans-serif][size=120]It is easy, just endorse as many nations as possible, which will make you turn blue, and then, when everyone starts to endorse you back, you will grow larger and larger! Our goal is to have a lot of nations that are blue and large on the Portrait. Nations that are the largest and most blue on the Portrait will be given [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1054975][color=#ff9900]awards[/color][/url] each month to honor their efforts in making the region more secure and more active![/size][/font]
